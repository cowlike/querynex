========

Simple Groovy app to query Nexuiz servers. I am playing with some ideas to have a simple notifier for when players join a server I'm interested in. I started with [this code](https://code.google.com/p/tortilla/ this code) as my base, which I found when I was searching online for docs on the server protocol. 

The Tortilla code is very nice but I just wanted to parts to query the server since I'm not really interested in a GUI tool. His code really is quite nice though.
